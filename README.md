The scope of work is a flat project, meaning no npm or browserify
This has been been subdivided into tasks of roughly equal weight.
The entry point is issue #1

Don't fork this repo, instead as for an invite to steembots along with your user name in that steemit topic and you'll get an invite to the steembots team.
From there, simply choose an open issue and notify your intent and time frame within the issue.
You have up to a 12 hour lock on each issue once you claim the issue, but you can only keep a single issue at a time.

Most of these are flatten and normalize tasks.
